# Stack Manipulation Utilities for Seq
#
# Common stack operations built from primitives.
#
# ## Usage
#
#   include std:stack-utils
#
#   : main ( -- Int )
#     1 2 2dup  # Stack: 1 2 1 2
#     0
#   ;
#
# ## Available Primitives
#
# Seq provides these primitive stack operations:
# - dup, drop, swap, over, rot, nip, tuck, pick
#
# ## Available Functions
#
# - 2dup: ( A B -- A B A B ) - Duplicate top two values
# - 2drop: ( A B -- ) - Drop top two values
# - 3drop: ( A B C -- ) - Drop top three values
#
# ## Advanced Operations (Require pick)
#
# With the pick operation, you can build more complex utilities:
# - third: ( A B C -- A B C A ) via `2 pick`
# - fourth: ( A B C D -- A B C D A ) via `3 pick`
# - 3dup: ( A B C -- A B C A B C ) via `2 pick 2 pick 2 pick`
#
# ## Notes
#
# - These are building blocks for more complex stack manipulation
# - Operations are type-polymorphic (work with any value types)
# - Stack effects must balance within word definitions
#
# ## Examples
#
#   1 2 2dup         # Stack: 1 2 1 2
#   1 2 3 2drop      # Stack: 1
#   10 20 30 2 pick  # Stack: 10 20 30 10
#

# Duplicate top two values
: 2dup ( A B -- A B A B )
  over over
;

# Drop top two values
: 2drop ( A B -- )
  drop drop
;

# Triple drop
: 3drop ( A B C -- )
  drop drop drop
;
