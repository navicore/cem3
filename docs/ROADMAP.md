# cem3 Roadmap: Building a Solid Concatenative Foundation

## Philosophy

**Foundation First:** Get the concatenative core bulletproof before adding advanced features.

**No Compromises:** If something doesn't feel clean, stop and redesign.

**Test Everything:** Each phase has extensive tests before moving to the next.

**Learn from cem2:** Reference cem2 for "what not to do" and working examples.

**Concurrency is Core:** cem3 will be non-blocking from the start, inheriting cem2's proven CSP model (spawn/send/receive) with May coroutines. This is a defining characteristic of the language.

## Phase 0: Project Setup

### Goals
- Clean project structure
- Separate Value from StackNode from day 1
- Runtime only, no compiler yet (we'll use a simple test harness)

### Tasks
- [ ] Create `cem3/` directory structure
- [ ] Set up Rust runtime crate with proper module structure
- [ ] Define core types: `Value`, `StackNode`, `Stack`
- [ ] Write basic test harness (can push/pop values, call operations)
- [ ] Document the invariants we're maintaining

### Success Criteria
✓ Can push Int values on stack
✓ Can pop values off stack
✓ Stack is null when empty
✓ No memory leaks in basic push/pop

---

## Phase 1: Basic Stack Operations

### Goals
- Implement fundamental stack operations
- Prove that operations maintain invariants
- Test that operations compose correctly

### Operations to Implement
1. `dup: ( A -- A A )` - Copy top value
2. `drop: ( A -- )` - Remove top value
3. `swap: ( A B -- B A )` - Exchange top two

### Tasks
- [ ] Implement `dup` - must deep-copy values
- [ ] Implement `drop` - must free node but not worry about value (Value will handle its own cleanup)
- [ ] Implement `swap` - must correctly update next pointers
- [ ] Write tests for each operation in isolation
- [ ] Write tests for compositions: `dup swap drop` etc.
- [ ] Add assertions to verify stack structure after each op

### Success Criteria
✓ Each operation works with Int values
✓ Operations compose: `dup swap drop` leaves original value
✓ No memory leaks (run with valgrind/sanitizers)
✓ Stack structure is valid after any sequence

---

## Phase 2: Extended Stack Operations

### Goals
- Add more fundamental operations
- Test complex compositions
- Ensure shuffle patterns work correctly

### Operations to Implement
1. `over: ( A B -- A B A )` - Copy second
2. `rot: ( A B C -- B C A )` - Rotate top three
3. `nip: ( A B -- B )` - Remove second
4. `tuck: ( A B -- B A B )` - Copy top below second

### Tasks
- [ ] Implement each operation
- [ ] Test with Int values
- [ ] Test complex patterns: `rot swap rot`
- [ ] Verify stack order matches expected at each step
- [ ] Test the exact shuffle pattern from list-reverse: `rot swap rot rot swap`

### Success Criteria
✓ All operations work correctly with Int values
✓ Complex shuffle patterns produce correct stack order
✓ Stack structure remains valid
✓ No memory corruption or leaks

### Validation Test
```rust
// Stack starts: [10, 20, 30]
// After rot swap rot rot swap: [30, 10, 20]
#[test]
fn test_list_reverse_shuffle() {
    let stack = Stack::new();
    stack = push(stack, Value::Int(10));
    stack = push(stack, Value::Int(20));
    stack = push(stack, Value::Int(30));

    stack = rot(stack);
    stack = swap(stack);
    stack = rot(stack);
    stack = rot(stack);
    stack = swap(stack);

    let (stack, top) = pop(stack);
    assert_eq!(top, Value::Int(20));
    let (stack, second) = pop(stack);
    assert_eq!(second, Value::Int(10));
    let (_stack, third) = pop(stack);
    assert_eq!(third, Value::Int(30));
}
```

---

## Phase 3: Advanced Combinators

### Goals
- Implement `pick` and `dip`
- These are critical for flexible stack manipulation
- Prove they work with any stack depth

### Operations to Implement
1. `pick: ( ... N -- ... A )` - Copy Nth element (0 = top)
2. `dip: ( A [B -- C] -- C A )` - Execute quotation with top hidden

### Tasks
- [ ] Implement `pick` - must traverse stack correctly
- [ ] Test `pick` at various depths: 0, 1, 2, 5, 10
- [ ] Implement `dip` - requires quotation support (simple for now)
- [ ] Test `dip` with simple quotations
- [ ] Verify `pick` and `dip` compose with other ops

### Success Criteria
✓ `pick` works for any depth N
✓ `dip` correctly hides/restores top value
✓ Can implement complex patterns using pick/dip
✓ Stack structure remains valid

### Note
At this point we can pause and consider: **Is the core solid enough?**
- Can we shuffle arbitrarily without issues?
- Are operations composable?
- Is ownership clear?

**Only proceed to variants if YES to all above.**

---

## Phase 4: Simple Values (String, Bool)

### Goals
- Add more value types
- Ensure deep copying works correctly
- Test that all operations work with all value types

### Tasks
- [ ] Add `Value::Bool`
- [ ] Add `Value::String` (heap-allocated)
- [ ] Implement `Clone` for values (deep copy strings)
- [ ] Test all stack operations with Bool
- [ ] Test all stack operations with String
- [ ] Test mixed-type stacks: `[Int, String, Bool]`

### Success Criteria
✓ All operations work with all value types
✓ Strings are deep-copied correctly (no double-free)
✓ No memory leaks with heap-allocated values

---

## Phase 5: Single-Field Variants

### Goals
- Add variant support
- Prove that variants are independent of stack structure
- Test extraction + operations

### Tasks
- [ ] Define `VariantData` with fields as `Box<[Value]>`
- [ ] Implement `make_variant` for single-field (Some/None)
- [ ] Implement `extract_variant` - pushes field values on stack
- [ ] Test: Create `Some(42)`, extract, verify value
- [ ] Test: Create `Some(42)`, shuffle stack, extract - should still work

### Success Criteria
✓ Can create single-field variants
✓ Can extract fields
✓ Fields are independent of stack structure
✓ Shuffling before extraction doesn't break anything

### Critical Test
```rust
#[test]
fn test_variant_with_shuffle() {
    let stack = Stack::new();
    stack = push(stack, Value::Int(10));
    stack = push(stack, Value::Int(42));

    // Create Some(42)
    stack = make_variant(stack, TAG_SOME, 1);

    // Shuffle with another value
    stack = push(stack, Value::Int(99));
    stack = swap(stack);
    stack = dup(stack);
    stack = rot(stack);

    // Extract - should still work
    let (stack, variant) = pop(stack);
    stack = extract_variant(&variant, stack);

    let (stack, extracted) = pop(stack);
    assert_eq!(extracted, Value::Int(42));
}
```

---

## Phase 6: Multi-Field Variants

### Goals
- Add support for multiple fields
- Test the exact pattern that broke cem2
- Prove the new design is solid

### Tasks
- [ ] Implement `make_variant` for 2+ fields
- [ ] Test: Create `Cons(10, Nil)`
- [ ] Test: Extract Cons fields
- [ ] **Critical:** Create Cons, do `rot swap rot rot swap`, extract - MUST WORK
- [ ] Implement basic list operations: `list-head`, `list-tail`

### Success Criteria
✓ Can create multi-field variants
✓ Fields are stored in array, not linked by next pointers
✓ Extraction works after any shuffle pattern
✓ No crashes, no corruption

### The Crucial Test (What Broke cem2)
```rust
#[test]
fn test_cons_with_list_reverse_shuffle() {
    let stack = Stack::new();

    // Create Cons(10, Nil)
    stack = push(stack, make_nil());
    stack = push(stack, Value::Int(10));
    stack = make_variant(stack, TAG_CONS, 2);

    // Simulate match extraction
    let (stack, cons) = pop(stack);
    stack = push(stack, make_nil()); // acc
    stack = extract_variant(&cons, stack);
    // Stack now: [acc, head, tail]

    // Do the exact shuffle from list-reverse-helper
    stack = rot(stack);
    stack = swap(stack);
    stack = rot(stack);
    stack = rot(stack);
    stack = swap(stack);
    // Stack now: [tail, head, acc]

    // Create new Cons(head, acc)
    // Reorder: [head, acc]
    stack = rot(stack); // [head, tail, acc]
    let (stack, _tail) = pop(stack); // drop tail
    stack = swap(stack); // [acc, head]

    stack = make_variant(stack, TAG_CONS, 2);

    // Extract again - MUST WORK
    let (stack, new_cons) = pop(stack);
    stack = extract_variant(&new_cons, stack);

    let (stack, head) = pop(stack);
    assert_eq!(head, Value::Int(10));
}
```

**This test MUST pass before moving forward.**

---

## Phase 7: List Operations

### Goals
- Implement list operations as proof of correct foundation
- These are real-world use cases
- If these work, the foundation is solid

### Operations to Implement
1. `list-reverse-helper` - The exact pattern that broke cem2
2. `list-map-helper` - Uses pick for stack manipulation
3. `list-filter`
4. `list-fold`

### Tasks
- [ ] Implement list-reverse using the shuffle pattern
- [ ] Test with single-element list
- [ ] Test with multi-element list
- [ ] Test with deep recursion (100+ elements)
- [ ] Implement list-map using pick
- [ ] Test list-map with shuffle patterns

### Success Criteria
✓ list-reverse works with any list length
✓ list-map works correctly
✓ No stack corruption
✓ No memory leaks even with deep recursion
✓ All operations compose cleanly

---

## Phase 8: Add Compiler (Basic)

### Goals
- Now that runtime is solid, add compiler
- Keep runtime clean, compiler emits to clean runtime API
- Minimal type checking for safety (stack underflow, branch compatibility)

### Tasks
- [x] Simple parser for basic constructs (word definitions, literals, calls)
- [x] Minimal type checker:
  - [x] Stack depth tracking
  - [x] Conditional branch stack effect validation
  - [x] Stack underflow detection
- [x] Codegen targeting clean runtime API (LLVM IR)
- [x] Basic control flow (if/else/then conditionals)
- [x] Comparison operators (=, <, >, <=, >=, <>)
- [x] Ensure codegen emits correct operations
- [x] Test compiled programs match hand-written runtime tests

### Success Criteria
✓ Can compile simple programs with conditionals
✓ Compiled code behaves identically to runtime tests
✓ Type checker catches stack underflow at compile time
✓ Type checker validates conditional branches have same stack effects

### What's Missing
The current type checker is **minimal** - it tracks stack *depth* but not actual *types*. This is sufficient for basic safety but lacks:
- Type inference for user-defined words
- Stack effect declarations
- Full type tracking (distinguishing Int vs String at compile time)
- Row polymorphism for extensible stack effects
- Quotation types
- Variant/ADT type checking

These are addressed in Phase 8.5 below.

---

## Phase 8.5: Type System Design & Implementation ✓ COMPLETE

**Status:** Complete (October 2024)

### Goals Achieved
- ✅ Designed and implemented full type system with row polymorphism
- ✅ Bidirectional type checking (declared effects, verified bodies)
- ✅ Clear type error messages with stack effect context
- ✅ Zero runtime cost - all checking at compile time

### What Was Implemented

#### 1. Enhanced Type Checker (`compiler/src/typechecker.rs`)
- [x] Full type tracking (not just stack depth)
- [x] Row polymorphism support with `RowVar`
- [x] Unification-based verification (Hindley-Milner style)
- [x] Two-pass checking: collect signatures, then verify bodies
- [x] Comprehensive error messages

#### 2. Row-Polymorphic Built-ins (`compiler/src/builtins.rs`)
- [x] All 25 built-ins use row polymorphism
- [x] Stack operations: `dup: ( ..a T -- ..a T T )`
- [x] Arithmetic: `add: ( ..a Int Int -- ..a Int )`
- [x] I/O: `write_line: ( ..a String -- ..a )`
- [x] CSP operations: `send`, `receive`, `make-channel`

#### 3. Type System Infrastructure
- [x] Type data structures (`types.rs`): Int, String, Var, StackType, Effect
- [x] Unification algorithm (`unification.rs`): Type and row variable unification
- [x] Stack effect parser (part of parser.rs): `( ..a Int -- ..a Bool )`
- [x] Substitution composition for constraint solving

#### 4. Comprehensive Testing
- [x] 25 type checker tests (13 core + 12 edge cases)
- [x] Tests cover: literals, operations, branches, underflow, polymorphism
- [x] Edge cases: empty programs, nested conditionals, complex shuffling
- [x] 114 total tests passing (68 compiler + 46 runtime)

### Success Criteria Met
✅ Stack effects verified for all operations
✅ Row polymorphism works: `dup` has type `( ..a T -- ..a T T )`
✅ Type safety: no type mismatches at compile time
✅ Stack safety: no underflows detected at compile time
✅ Branch verification: conditionals produce consistent effects
✅ Type errors are clear and actionable
✅ Zero runtime cost

### Current Limitations
These features are **deferred** to future phases:
- ❌ **Quotations**: First-class functions not yet implemented (future phase)
- ❌ **User-defined types**: Only Int and String currently (future phase)
- ❌ **Variant type checking**: ADTs not yet implemented (future phase)
- ❌ **Type inference**: Effects must be declared (acceptable for now)
- ❌ **Diverging functions**: Functions like `forever` that never return are typed as if they do return (with unchanged stack). A proper "never" type (like Rust's `!`) would be more precise, but current behavior is safe and correct.

### Documentation
- **User Guide**: `docs/TYPE_SYSTEM_GUIDE.md` - How to use the type system
- **Design Notes**: `docs/TYPE_SYSTEM_DESIGN_NOTES.md` - Implementation details
- **Examples**: See guide for comprehensive examples

### Example

```cem
: fibonacci-check ( Int Int -- String )
  > if
    "first is larger"
  else
    "second is larger or equal"
  then ;
```

Type checker verifies:
1. `>` effect: `( ..a Int Int -- ..a Int )`
2. Both branches produce: `String`
3. Final effect matches declared: `( Int Int -- String )` ✓

### Key Insights

**What Worked:**
- Bidirectional checking (declare effects, verify bodies) is simple and clear
- Row polymorphism is essential for concatenative languages
- Unification provides elegant constraint solving
- cem2's type system foundation was sound (we built on it)

**What We Simplified:**
- No attempt at full type inference (requires declaration)
- No quotations yet (hard problem, deferred)
- Simple error messages (good enough for now)

**Performance:**
- Type checking is fast (< 1ms for current test suite)
- Zero runtime cost - types erased after checking

## Phase 9: Memory Management (Deterministic, Zero-Cost) ✅ COMPLETE

### Status: **COMPLETE** (2025-10-25)

**Result:** Two-tier memory management with no garbage collection
- **Phase 9.1:** Stack node pooling (~10x faster than malloc)
- **Phase 9.2:** Arena allocation for strings (~20x faster for temporaries)

### Goals
- Stop leaking memory with deterministic, zero-cost management
- **No garbage collection** - Forth-style pools + arena allocators
- Maintain Rust-like deterministic performance

### What We Built

#### Phase 9.1: Stack Node Pool
- Thread-local pool with 256 pre-allocated nodes (max 1024)
- Integrated into all stack operations (push, pop, dup, swap, etc.)
- ~10x faster than malloc/free
- **Tests:** 50+ passing (pool.rs, stack.rs, scheduler.rs)

#### Phase 9.2: Arena Allocation for Strings
- **CemString type** with dual allocation strategy:
  - `arena_string()`: Thread-local bump allocator (~5ns)
  - `global_string()`: Global heap (~100ns)
- Arena reset on strand exit (bulk free, zero overhead)
- CSP-safe: Channel sends clone to global allocator
- **Tests:** 68 passing including arena+strands+channels integration
- **Design doc:** `docs/ARENA_ALLOCATION_DESIGN.md`

### Tasks
- [x] Implement thread-local stack node pool
- [x] Integrate pool into stack operations
- [x] Implement CemString with arena/global allocation
- [x] Implement arena allocator with bumpalo
- [x] Update Value enum to use CemString
- [x] Update all I/O operations for CemString
- [x] Integrate arena reset into scheduler (strand lifecycle)
- [x] Test arena allocation with strands and channels
- [x] Test long-running strands (no memory growth)

### Success Criteria ✓
✅ Long-running programs don't leak memory
✅ Arena reset on strand exit (automatic cleanup)
✅ ~20x performance improvement for temporary strings
✅ ~10x performance improvement for stack operations
✅ All 146 tests pass (78 compiler + 68 runtime)
✅ CSP strands can run indefinitely (HTTP server ready)

### Actual Effort
2 sessions (as estimated)

### String Interning Decision
**Deferred to Phase 10** - Arena allocation solves temporary string performance.
Interning only needed if benchmarks show string *literals* are a bottleneck.
**See:** `docs/STRING_INTERNING_DESIGN.md` (updated for Phase 9.2)

### Future Enhancements (Post-Phase 9)

**Observability & Monitoring:**
- [ ] Expose pool/arena stats via runtime API
- [ ] Log metrics for pool overflow events
- [ ] Track arena reset frequency
- [ ] Detect thread migration (if it occurs)

**Performance Validation:**
- [ ] Add benchmarks for stack operations (validate 10x claim)
- [ ] Add benchmarks for string allocation (validate 20x claim)
- [ ] Benchmark concurrent scenarios (many strands)
- [ ] Compare vs cem2 performance

**Configurability:**
- [ ] Make arena auto-reset threshold configurable
- [ ] Make pool size configurable (currently 256 initial, 1024 max)
- [ ] Per-workload tuning support

**Testing:**
- [ ] More integration tests for concurrent scenarios
- [ ] Stress test with mixed arena/global string patterns
- [ ] Test arena behavior under thread migration
- [ ] Valgrind verification (no leaks)

---

## Phase 10.1: Loop Combinators & Iteration

**Goal:** Enable idiomatic server loops and iteration patterns

### Combinators Already Implemented ✓
- [x] `call: ( [quot] -- )` - Execute quotation immediately
- [x] `times: ( n [quot] -- )` - Execute quotation n times
- [x] `while: ( [cond] [body] -- )` - Loop while condition is true
- [x] `spawn: ( [quot] -- strand-id )` - Execute quotation in new strand

### New Combinators Needed
- [x] `forever: ( ..a [quot] -- ..a )` - Infinite loop (critical for servers) ✓ IMPLEMENTED
  - Example: `[ tcp-accept handle-client ] forever`
  - **Type system note:** Currently typed as if it returns (with unchanged stack), but never returns in practice. A proper "never" type would be more precise. See Phase 8.5 limitations.
  - Implementation: `runtime/src/quotations.rs:177-194`
- [x] `until: ( ..a [body] [cond] -- ..a )` - Loop until condition is true (do-while style) ✓ IMPLEMENTED
  - Example: `[ read-chunk ] [ is-complete ] until`
  - Implementation: `runtime/src/quotations.rs:196-263`
- [ ] `each: ( array [quot] -- )` - Iterate over array elements **BLOCKED: Requires array support**
  - Example: `routes [ match-route ] each`

### Tasks
- [x] Implement `forever` combinator in runtime ✓
- [x] Add LLVM declaration for `forever` ✓
- [x] Add type signature for `forever` to builtins ✓
- [x] Test with HTTP server (handles multiple connections) ✓
- [x] Implement `until` combinator ✓
- [x] Add LLVM declaration for `until` ✓
- [x] Add type signature for `until` to builtins ✓
- [x] Test `until` combinator (countdown, do-while semantics) ✓
- [ ] Implement `each` combinator **BLOCKED: requires array iteration**
- [ ] Test complex nesting (forever + spawn + times)
- [ ] Test break/continue patterns (if needed)

### Success Criteria
✓ Can write `[ accept-connection ] forever`
✓ Can write `urls [ fetch ] each`
✓ Combinators compose cleanly
✓ No stack corruption with nested loops

### Example: HTTP Server Loop
```cem
: handle-client ( client-id -- )
  dup tcp-read
  route-request     # Returns response
  swap tcp-write
  tcp-close ;

: main ( -- )
  9999 tcp-listen
  [ tcp-accept handle-client spawn drop ] forever ;
```

**Estimated Effort:** 1 session

---

## Phase 10.2: String Operations

**Goal:** String manipulation for HTTP request/response handling

### Operations Already Implemented ✓
- [x] `int->string: ( Int -- String )` - Convert integer to string
- [x] String literals in source code
- [x] `write_line: ( String -- )` - Output strings

### New String Operations Needed
- [ ] `string-concat: ( str1 str2 -- result )` - Join strings
  - Example: `"HTTP/1.1 " status string-concat`
- [ ] `string-length: ( str -- int )` - Get string length
  - Example: `body string-length int->string` (for Content-Length)
- [ ] `string-split: ( str delim -- array )` - Split by delimiter
  - Example: `"GET /api/users" " " string-split` → `["GET", "/api/users"]`
- [ ] `string-starts-with: ( str prefix -- bool )` - Check prefix
  - Example: `path "/api" string-starts-with`
- [ ] `string-contains: ( str substring -- bool )` - Check substring
  - Example: `header "gzip" string-contains`
- [ ] `string-trim: ( str -- trimmed )` - Remove whitespace
- [ ] `string-to-upper: ( str -- upper )` - Convert to uppercase
- [ ] `string-to-lower: ( str -- lower )` - Convert to lowercase

### Tasks
- [ ] Implement string operations in runtime (runtime/src/string_ops.rs)
- [ ] Add LLVM declarations
- [ ] Add type signatures to builtins
- [ ] Test with arena allocation (phase 9.2)
- [ ] Test with UTF-8 strings
- [ ] Document string memory model (arena vs global)

### Success Criteria
✓ Can build HTTP responses with string-concat
✓ Can parse HTTP requests with string-split
✓ No memory leaks with temporary strings
✓ Performance acceptable (arena allocation helps)

### Example: Build HTTP Response
```cem
: http-ok ( body -- response )
  dup string-length int->string      # ( body len-str )
  "HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\n"
  "Content-Type: text/plain\r\n"
  string-concat
  "Content-Length: " string-concat
  swap string-concat                  # Add length
  "\r\n\r\n" string-concat
  swap string-concat ;                # Add body
```

**Estimated Effort:** 1 session

---

## Phase 10.3: Pattern Matching & Destructuring

**Goal:** Route HTTP requests and destructure data structures

**Critical:** Without pattern matching, HTTP servers are impractical. This is NOT optional.

### What We Need

#### 1. Variant Pattern Matching
```cem
# Match on ADT constructors
: handle-result ( Result -- )
  match
    Ok value => [ "Success: " swap string-concat write_line ]
    Err msg => [ "Error: " swap string-concat write_line ]
  end ;
```

#### 2. String Pattern Matching (HTTP Routes)
```cem
: route-request ( request -- response )
  string-split first  # Get method and path
  match
    "GET /" => [ "Hello, World!" http-ok ]
    "GET /api/users" => [ get-users http-ok ]
    "POST /api/users" => [ create-user http-ok ]
    _ => [ "Not Found" http-404 ]
  end ;
```

#### 3. Destructuring Bindings
```cem
: parse-request ( str -- method path )
  " " string-split
  match
    [method, path, ...] => [ method path ]  # Bind and extract
    _ => [ "GET" "/" ]  # Default
  end ;
```

### Tasks

#### Design Phase (1 session)
- [ ] Design match syntax (study Factor, Kitten, OCaml)
- [ ] Decide: expression-based or statement-based?
- [ ] Handle exhaustiveness checking
- [ ] Design wildcard patterns (`_`)
- [ ] Design guard clauses (if needed)

#### Implementation Phase (2 sessions)
- [ ] Add `match` to AST
- [ ] Implement pattern parsing
- [ ] Add pattern type checking
- [ ] Generate LLVM IR for match (likely jump tables)
- [ ] Implement variant destructuring
- [ ] Implement string/literal matching
- [ ] Add exhaustiveness checking

#### Testing Phase (1 session)
- [ ] Test variant matching
- [ ] Test string matching (HTTP routes)
- [ ] Test nested patterns
- [ ] Test exhaustiveness errors
- [ ] Test with quotations in match arms

### Success Criteria
✓ Can route HTTP requests with clean syntax
✓ Can destructure variants (Ok/Err, Cons/Nil)
✓ Exhaustiveness checking catches missing cases
✓ Generated code is efficient (jump tables)
✓ Pattern matching composes with quotations

### Example: Complete HTTP Router
```cem
: route ( request -- response )
  parse-http-request  # ( method path headers body )
  rot rot            # ( headers body method path )

  match
    ["GET", "/"] =>
      [ drop drop "Welcome!" http-ok ]

    ["GET", path] =>
      [ drop drop path get-resource http-ok ]

    ["POST", "/api/users"] =>
      [ swap drop create-user http-ok ]  # Use body

    ["DELETE", path] =>
      [ drop drop path delete-resource http-ok ]

    [method, path] =>
      [ "Method " method string-concat
        " not allowed for " string-concat
        path string-concat
        http-405 ]
  end ;
```

**Estimated Effort:** 3-4 sessions

**Critical Path:** This MUST be done before claiming HTTP server support.

---

## Phase 10.4: User-Defined Types & Constructors

**Goal:** Model domain concepts cleanly

### Tasks
- [ ] Variant type definitions
- [ ] Constructor functions
- [ ] Type aliases
- [ ] Newtype wrappers

**Estimated Effort:** 2-3 sessions

**Priority:** Lower - can use pattern matching on built-in types first

---

## Phase 10.5: Module System & Organization

**Goal:** Organize larger programs

### Tasks
- [ ] Module definitions
- [ ] Import/export
- [ ] Namespacing
- [ ] **String optimization** - Consider interning (see `docs/STRING_INTERNING_DESIGN.md`)

**Estimated Effort:** 3-4 sessions

**Priority:** Needed when code bases grow beyond single file

---

## Phase 11+: Linear Types (Aspirational)

### Goals
- Use compile-time type system to prove when values can be freed
- **Zero runtime cost** - all analysis at compile time
- Like Rust's borrow checker, **NOT garbage collection**

### Background
Linear types enable compile-time memory safety without runtime overhead:
- **Linear type**: Value used exactly once
- **Affine type**: Value used at most once
- Compiler inserts `free()` calls where values provably dead
- Reject programs that violate linearity
- Zero runtime cost - all checks at compile time

**This is NOT GC:** No tracing, no pauses, no runtime overhead. Pure static analysis.

### Prerequisites
- Phase 8.5 (type system) complete
- Phase 9 (memory management) working
- Research Rust's borrow checker, Linear Haskell

### Challenges
- Very complex to implement (Rust took years)
- User friction (error messages, learning curve)
- Interaction with CSP (channel sends = moves)
- Quotations complicate ownership

### Research Questions
1. Can linearity be optional (like Rust's `unsafe`)?
2. Can we infer linearity without annotations?
3. How does this interact with quotations?

### Recommended Approach
**Don't rush this.** Get Phase 9 working first. Linear types are cutting-edge PL research.

**See:** `docs/MEMORY_MANAGEMENT_DESIGN.md` for detailed analysis.

## Completed Phases

### ✅ Phase 10: Concurrency with Strands (CSP Model)

**Status:** COMPLETE ✓

**Implementation:**
- Brought cem2's proven CSP model to cem3
- May coroutines for efficient concurrency
- Erlang-inspired strands with Go-style channels

### Background
cem2 successfully implemented a concurrency model using:
- **Strands**: Lightweight processes (like Erlang processes)
- **CSP Communication**: Go-style channels for send/receive
- **May Coroutines**: Green threads for efficient concurrency
- **Non-blocking I/O**: All I/O operations yield instead of blocking OS threads

This model worked well in cem2 and will be brought forward to cem3.

### Tasks
- [ ] Initialize May runtime in generated `main()` function
- [ ] Make all I/O operations non-blocking (yield to scheduler)
  - [ ] Update `write_line` to use async I/O
  - [ ] Update `read_line` to use async I/O
- [ ] Add scheduler infrastructure to runtime
- [ ] Implement core concurrency operations:
  - [ ] `spawn: ( [quotation] -- strand-id )` - Create new strand
  - [ ] `send: ( value channel -- )` - Send to channel
  - [ ] `receive: ( channel -- value )` - Receive from channel (blocks strand, not thread)
- [ ] Add channel creation and management
- [ ] Test basic strand spawning and communication
- [ ] Test complex patterns (many strands, message passing)
- [ ] Verify no OS thread blocking on I/O

### Success Criteria
✓ Can spawn multiple strands
✓ Strands communicate via channels
✓ I/O operations are non-blocking (use May's async primitives)
✓ Thousands of strands can run efficiently
✓ No OS thread starvation
✓ CSP patterns from cem2 port cleanly

### Architecture Notes
- LLVM-generated code calls runtime functions (already in place)
- Runtime functions are May-aware (yield appropriately)
- Each strand has its own stack pointer
- Stack-threading model works naturally with strands
- No changes needed to codegen - it's all in the runtime

### Example Usage
```cem
: worker ( channel -- )
  receive        # Block this strand until message arrives
  write_line     # Print the message
;

: main ( -- )
  make-channel   # Create a channel
  [ worker ] spawn  # Spawn worker strand with channel
  "Hello from main!" swap send  # Send message to worker
;
```

## Validation Throughout

At each phase, we MUST:
1. **Run all previous phase tests** - no regressions
2. **Check for memory leaks** - valgrind clean
3. **Verify invariants** - add runtime assertions in debug builds
4. **Document any compromises** - if we make one, write it down

## When to Consult cem2

- **Reference for "what not to do"** - look at how cem2 conflated cells and values
- **Working examples** - cem2's type checker, parser may be reusable
- **Test cases** - cem2's test programs can be ported to cem3

## Decision Points

### After Phase 3: Is the Core Solid?
If we can't shuffle arbitrarily without issues, **STOP and redesign**.

### After Phase 6: Do Variants Work?
If the crucial test fails, **STOP and reconsider design**.

### After Phase 7: Is the Foundation Ready?
If list operations work cleanly, we can confidently build anything on this foundation.

## Success Metrics for cem3

At the end, we should be able to say:
- ✓ Values are completely independent of stack structure
- ✓ Any stack operation can be combined with any other
- ✓ Variants work with arbitrary shuffle patterns
- ✓ No memory leaks, no crashes
- ✓ Clear ownership model throughout
- ✓ Easy to add new features without breaking core
- ✓ Non-blocking I/O with efficient strand-based concurrency (CSP model)
- ✓ Thousands of strands can run concurrently without OS thread starvation

  - Import/export, namespacing

**Total to prove foundation:** ~6-8 sessions to validated list operations ✓ **DONE**

**Total to working typed compiler:** ~9 sessions including Phase 8.5 ✓ **DONE**

**Total to working memory management:** ~11 sessions including Phase 9 ✓ **DONE**

**Total to basic HTTP server:** ~12 sessions including Phase 9.5 ✓ **DONE**

**Total to production HTTP server:** ~17 sessions (including 10.1, 10.2, 10.3) - **IN PROGRESS**

**Current status:** Phase 9.5 complete (TCP networking working)

**Next milestone:** Phases 10.1-10.3 (HTTP Server Stack)
- 10.1: Loop combinators for server loops
- 10.2: String operations for HTTP parsing/building
