# Test pick operation - accessing arbitrary stack depths
#
# The pick operation copies a value from depth n to the top of stack:
# - pick(0) is equivalent to dup (copy top)
# - pick(1) is equivalent to over (copy second)
# - pick(2) copies third value
# - etc.
#
# Stack effect: ( ..stack n -- ..stack value )
