# FFI libedit Demo
#
# Demonstrates using the ffi:libedit module to create an interactive REPL
# with line editing and persistent history support.
#
# Features:
#   - Line editing (arrow keys, backspace, etc.)
#   - Session history (up/down arrows)
#   - Persistent history saved to ~/.seq-demo-history
#
# libedit is a BSD-licensed alternative to GNU readline, providing the
# same API without GPL licensing requirements.
#
# Build and run:
#   seqc examples/ffi/libedit-demo.seq -o libedit-demo
#   ./libedit-demo
#
# Installation:
#   macOS: Already installed (Apple ships libedit)
#   Ubuntu: apt install libedit-dev
#   Fedora: dnf install libedit-devel
